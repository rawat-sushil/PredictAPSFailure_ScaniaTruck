# PredictAPSFailure_ScaniaTruck
Using machine learning methods , Predict component failure associated with APS system in Scania Trucks

Analysis of data generated by the vehicle ECU’s( electronic control unit) can be very helpful in vehicle maintenance and reducing potential breakdown. The main objective of this paper is to perform predictive analysis on Air pressure system data from Scania Trucks for component failure using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support vector machine and k-Nearest Neighbor machine learning methods. Since data-preprocessing is an important step in overall process of machine learning so techniques for handling missing values , feature scaling and class imbalance would also be covered. 15 different metrics would be used to compare the result of all the implemented machine learning methods.
